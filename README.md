# Bash_Practice_problems
# UserMenu.sh

This script is designed to provide a user-friendly menu-based interface that allows users to make selections and access corresponding information or functionalities. It follows a structured flow:

## Menu-Based Interaction

- The script initiates by creating a while loop, ensuring that the user remains engaged until they choose to exit the program.

- Within this loop, a menu is presented to the user, tailored to meet specific demands or information needs they may have.

## User Input Handling

- A variable named 'option' is established to capture the user's input. This input is vital as it drives subsequent actions within the script.

- A case statement is implemented, leveraging the 'option' variable to determine the execution of specific commands or processes based on the user's selections.

## Error Handling

- Towards the conclusion of the script, a mechanism for handling errors is incorporated. It addresses scenarios where the user provides an input that is not recognized or valid. In such cases, the program gracefully informs the user about the invalid input, promoting a user-friendly experience.
